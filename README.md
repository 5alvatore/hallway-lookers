# Hallway Lookers

An informative AR-based game.

## Setting up dev environment

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Replace the @viro-community npm package with the unofficial one

You should be able to find it in the group chat.

3. Run the build and debug

```bash
expo run:android
```

Voila! Setup complete

## Note

The AR demo is in place now. You'll have access to it once you successfully login.

## Contribution

The master branch should be kept clean. All changes should be done in a separate branch and should be merged once it has been signed off by QA.
